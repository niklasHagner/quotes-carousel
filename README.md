# quotes-carousel
Rotating quotes from the likes of Djikstra and Torvalds. Just something fun for the TV at the office

* Automatically rotates between quotes
* Quotes are defined in the html like `<blockquote data-timeout="7000"><p>Quote here</p></blockquote>` - timeout defines how many milliseconds the quote will appear on screen
